    <h1>IAM Experience: MFA with PingID, PingOne Admin:</h1>
    <p>As a "PingFederate Administrator" or "PingOne Cloud Administrator," I led the configuration and management of authentication and multi-factor authentication (MFA) settings within the PingOne Cloud tenant. Responsibilities encompassed redirecting users to PingID for MFA, enabling diverse authentication methods, and maintaining the security of the IAM system. I managed user access, administered devices and services, defined identity repositories, and conducted advanced diagnostics, all crucial to ensuring secure and efficient user authentication.</p>
