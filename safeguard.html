    <h2>Technical Skills:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safeguard Implementation and Documentation:</strong> Collaborated on the implementation of OneIdentity's Safeguard solution, meticulously documenting various use cases and procedures for internal IT security teams. Utilized tools like Confluence and JIRA to create detailed technical documentation outlining workflows for privileged account access, emergency access, and password management. This documentation enhanced internal processes and accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Account Management:</strong> Orchestrated the collection, organization, and secure storage of service accounts and associated passwords within internal systems. Implemented best practices, such as password rotation policies and encryption of stored passwords, using HashiCorp Vault. Conducted regular access reviews and audits to identify and remediate security risks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Problem-solving Skills:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internal User Education and UI Configuration:</strong> Played a pivotal role in internal user education, conducting workshops and training sessions for security teams to familiarize them with Safeguard's features and capabilities. Leveraged internal webinars and Slack channels to facilitate knowledge sharing. Assisted in configuring Safeguard's UI settings, including session recording via Syslog integration and access policies with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), aligning with internal security policies and user needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Communication Skills:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Case Documentation:</strong> Created comprehensive documentation outlining use cases across internal IT security departments. This documentation included detailed step-by-step guides on configuring Safeguard for specific scenarios, such as privileged access requests and emergency access. Used Markdown syntax within Git repositories to maintain version-controlled documentation, ensuring efficient and consistent execution of these critical tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Teamwork Skills:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaboration with IT Security Departments:</strong> Collaborated closely with internal IT security departments, actively participating in Agile ceremonies like sprint planning and daily standups to gather insights into unique requirements. Incorporated their feedback into the Safeguard configuration, ensuring tailored solutions that met internal security standards and needs. Utilized Git branching strategies for collaborative code reviews and contributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Creation and Transition:</strong> Managed the creation of admin and local accounts within Safeguard, leveraging tools like Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Ansible for configuration management. Ensured appropriate access levels for security personnel using Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Conducted thorough audits using Splunk to identify and remove old user credentials before transitioning from the previous TPAM system, ensuring a clean and secure transition of privileged access management.</li>
    </ul>
